                I am a person who loves to learn, and I will learn about anything and everything I can.
            There is so much knowledge out in the world and I am fascinated by all of it. I have a degree in biomedical
            science from Colorado State University.I have work experience in medical offices, and have worked with the technology and interfaces that they use.
            This inspired an intrest in improving how the current systems run. This lead me to an intrest in coding
            and am currently persuing a coding bootcamp certificate course through the University of Denver.
